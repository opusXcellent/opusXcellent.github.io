        <h2>For My Father</h2>
        <p>This site is dedicated to my father, who lovingly preserved these fragile 8mm films across the decades. Inside those frames are moments frozen in time... Our family's birthdays, holidays, vacations, and everyday life that might have otherwise been forgotten.</p>

        <p>I created this archive to honor him and his dedication to preserving these memories of family and friends. It is my hope that you enjoy these films, help identify faces and places, and relive some of the joy and history they capture.</p>    
                
        <h2>Why I Digitized the Films Myself</h2>
        <p>In researching professional digitization services, I found that many companies focused heavily on upselling additional services after receiving the films, essentailly holding your films hostage. While some high-quality providers do exist, they were costly — typically charging between <strong>40 to 50 cents per foot</strong> plus shipping and fees.</p>

        <p>With over 5,000 feet of film in our collection, the cost would have exceeded <strong>$2,000</strong>. I decided instead to purchase a home digitizer and take on the scanning myself. This allowed me to maintain control over the process and ensure the films were handled with care. The results may lack the quality of professional equipment, but with help from open source video editing software called <strong>Shotcut</strong>, I am able to reduce noise, stabilize, sharpen and adjust coloring where necessary. </p>

        <p>The film is cleaned by hand with <strong>FilmGuard</strong>, a well-known industry product used for cleaning and lubrication. This helps remove dust, and conditions the film for smoother handling. My father also preserved the original tools used for editing, cutting, and splicing 8mm film. Several reels required repair, and I’ve taken on the task of restoring them using those very same tools.</p>

        <p>This has been a long but rewarding journey, and I’m proud to share the results here.</p>
