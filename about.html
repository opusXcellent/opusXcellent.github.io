        <h2>For My Father</h2>
        <p>This site is dedicated to my father, who preserved these fragile 8mm films for decades. Inside every frame are moments frozen in time. They capture birthdays, holidays, vacations, and everyday life that might have otherwise been forgotten.</p>

        <p>I created this archive to honor a truly great man and his commitment for preserving memories of family and friends. It is my hope that you enjoy these films, help identify faces and places, and relive some of the joy and history they capture.</p>

        <h2>Recreating Memories</h2>

        <p>One of the 3-inch reels very briefly showed my father's Lionel train set from the 1950s. He used to say he bought it with his own money, and he was proud of that. Unfortunately, the trains were barely visible in that short piece of film and were not digitally captured.</p>
        <p>In 2014, my father and I built a new layout together in the basement of my home, using his original Lionel trains and accessories. I designed and built the table and laid out the track, while my father meticulously organized and placed the buildings, cars, houses, and scenery. The outer loop is a modern train, but everything else is from his original collection.</p>
        <p>Today, everything remains exactly as he left it.</p>

        <br><h2>Why I Digitized the Films Myself</h2>
        <p>In researching companies that offer professional film digitization, I found that many focus heavily on upselling additional services after receiving your films, essentially holding them hostage. While there are high-quality providers available, their services tend to be expensive, typically charging between <strong>$0.30</strong> and <strong>$0.50</strong> per foot, not including shipping and additional fees.</p>

        <p>With over 6,000 feet of film, the cost could exceeded <strong>$2,000</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>I decided instead to purchase a home digitizer and take on the scanning myself. This allowed me to maintain control over the process and ensure the films were handled with care. The results may lack the quality of professional equipment, but with help from open source video editing software called <strong>Shotcut</strong>, I am able to reduce noise, stabilize, sharpen and adjust coloring where necessary. </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The film is cleaned by hand with <strong>FilmGuard</strong>, a well-known industry product used for cleaning and lubrication. This helps remove dust, and conditions the film for smoother handling. My father also preserved the original tools used for editing, cutting, and splicing 8mm film. Several reels required repair, and I‚Äôve taken on the task of restoring them using those very same tools.</p>

        <p>This has been a long but rewarding journey, and I‚Äôm proud to share the results here.</p>
