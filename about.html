    <h2>A Labor of Love for My Father</h2>
    <p>This site is dedicated to my father, who carefully saved these precious reels of 8mm and Super 8 film over the years. Inside those frames are moments frozen in time — our family's birthdays, holidays, vacations, and everyday life that might have otherwise been forgotten.</p>

    <p>I created this archive to honor his dedication and to make these memories available to family and friends around the world. It is my hope that you enjoy these films, help identify faces and places, and relive some of the joy and history they capture.</p>

    <h2>Why I Digitized the Films Myself</h2>
    <p>In researching professional digitization services, I found that many companies focused heavily on upselling additional services after receiving the films. While some high-quality providers do exist, they were costly — typically charging between <strong>40 to 50 cents per foot</strong>.</p>

    <p>With over 3,000 feet of film in our collection, the cost would have exceeded <strong>$1,500</strong>. I decided instead to purchase a home digitizer and take on the scanning myself. This allowed me to maintain control over the process and ensure the films were handled with care.</p>

    <p>Before scanning, each reel is cleaned using a well-known industry product called <strong>FilmGuard</strong>. This helps remove dust and condition the film for smoother handling. My father also had the original tools for splicing, and I’ve come across several reels that are in need of repair — a task I’ve taken on with his equipment.</p>

    <p>This has been a long but rewarding journey, and I’m proud to share the results here. Thank you for being part of this story.</p>
